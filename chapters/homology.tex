\chapter{Homological Algebra} 

Though strictly homological algebra doesn't
belong to the study of commutative algbra, it is so widely used in fields
such as geometry and algebra that it would be a waste not to write a short
exposition on it. Throughout this chapter we will assume that our objects are
modules over a commutative ring though the results hold for any ``abelian
category.'' Historically homological algebra developed out of algebraic
topology; originally homology was considered a series of numbers that keep
track of what we now call the ``Betti numbers.'' The section on history can
be skipped without impairing understanding but should be read if the reader
is looking for the motivation for some of the ideas we will study.

\subsection{Origins of Homology: Simplicial Homology}

The first homology theory
to be developed was simplicial homology - the study of homology of simplicial
complexes. To be simple, we will not develop the general theory and instead
motivate our definitions with a few basic examples.  

\begin{example} Suppose
our simplicial complex has one line segment with both ends id entified at
one point $p$. Call the line segment $a$. The $n$-th homology group of this
space roughly counts how many ``different ways'' there are of finding $n$
dimensional sub-simplices that have no boundary that aren't the boundary of
any $n+1$ dimensional simplex. For the circle, notice that for each integer,
we can find such a way (namely the simplex that wraps counter clockwise that
integer number of times).
\end{example}
