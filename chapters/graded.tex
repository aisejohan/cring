\section{Graded rings and modules}

\subsection{Basic definitions}
We shall now review  a few facts from commutative algebra; for more details,
cf. \cite{Bo61}.
\begin{definition} 
A \textbf{graded ring} $R$ is a ring with a decomposition (as abelian groups)
\[  R = R_0 \oplus R_1 \oplus \dots   \]
such that $R_m R_n \subset R_{m+n}$ for all $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$,
and where $R_0$ is a subring.
A \textbf{$\mathbb{Z}$-graded ring} is one where the decomposition is into
$\bigoplus_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} R_n$.
In either case, the elements of the subgroup $R_n$ are called
\textbf{homogeneous of degree $n$}.

Let $M$ be an $R$-module. Then $M$ is called a \textbf{graded} $S$-module if
there is a decomposition
\[  M = \bigoplus_{k \in \mathbb{Z}} M_k  \]
as abelian groups, such that $R_m M_n \subset M_{m+n}$ for all $m \in
\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}, n \in \mathbb{Z}$.
\end{definition} 

Since we shall focus on positively graded rings, we shall simply call them
graded rings; when we do have to consider rings with possibly negative
gradings, we shall highlight this explicitly. Note however that we allow
modules with negative gradings freely.
In fact, given a graded module $M$, we define the \textbf{twists} $M(n)$ as the
same $S$-module but with the grading
\[  M(n)_k = M_{n+k} . \]  

\begin{example} 
The polynomial ring $A[x_1, \dots, x_n] $ is graded by the total degree. The
homogeneous elements of degree $n$ are the homogeneous polynomials of degree
$n$.
\end{example} 
\begin{example} 
If $R$ is  a graded ring, then $R$ is a graded module over itself. 
\end{example} 

\begin{definition} Fix a graded ring $R$.
Let $M$ be a graded $R$-module and $N$ an $R$-submodule. Then $N$ is called  a
\textbf{graded submodule} if the homogeneous components of anything in $N$ are
in $N$. If $M=R$, then a graded ideal is also called a \textbf{homogeneous
ideal}.
\end{definition} 

\begin{lemma} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item  The sum of two graded submodules (in particular, homogeneous ideals) is graded.
\item  The intersection of two graded submodules is graded.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma} 
\begin{proof} 
Immediate.
\end{proof} 

If $N \subset M$ is a graded submodule, then $M/N$ can be made into a graded
module, namely via the isomorphism of abelian groups
\[  M/N \simeq \sum_{k \in \mathbb{Z}} M_k/N_k.  \]
Also, if $\mathfrak{a}, \mathfrak{b}$ are homogeneous ideals, then so is
$\mathfrak{ab}$.  Justification: if we have resolutions into homogeneous
components $\mathfrak{a} = \bigoplus \mathfrak{a}_i$, $\mathfrak{b} = \bigoplus
\mathfrak{b}_i$, then 
\[  \mathfrak{ab} = \sum_{i+j=k} \mathfrak{a}_i \mathfrak{b}_j . \]



We now prove a result about homogeneous prime ideals specifically.
\begin{lemma} \label{homogeneousprimeideal}
Let $\mathfrak{p} \subset R$ be a homogeneous ideal. In order that $\mathfrak{p}$ be prime, it is
necessary and sufficient that whenever $x,y$ are \emph{homogeneous} elements
such that $xy \in \mathfrak{p}$, then at least one of $x,y \in \mathfrak{p}$.
\end{lemma} 
\begin{proof} 
Necessity is immediate. For sufficiency, suppose $a,b  \in R$ and $ab \in
\mathfrak{p}$. We must prove that one of these is in $\mathfrak{p}$. Write 
\[  a = a_0 + a_1  + \dots + a_k,  \ b = b_0 + \dots + b_m  \]
as a decomposition into homogeneous components, where $a_k, b_m$ are nonzero.

We will prove that one of $a,b \in \mathfrak{p}$ by induction on $m+n$. When this is
zero, then it is just the condition of the lemma.
Suppose it true for smaller values of $m+n$.
Then $ab$ has highest homogeneous component $a_k b_m$, which must be in $\mathfrak{p}$
by homogeneity.  Thus one of $a_k, b_m$ belongs to $\mathfrak{p}$. Say for
definiteness it is $a_k$. Then we have that
\[  (a-a_k)b \equiv ab \equiv 0 \  \mathrm{mod} \  \mathfrak{p}  \]
so that $(a-a_k)b \in \mathfrak{p}$. But the resolutions of $a-a_k, b$ have a smaller
$m+n$-value. By the inductive hypothesis, it follows that one of these is in
$\mathfrak{p}$, and since $a_k \in \mathfrak{p}$, we find that one of $a,b \in \mathfrak{p}$.  
\end{proof} 

\subsection{Finiteness conditions}
There are various finiteness conditions that we often want to impose on
projective schemes, so it is necessary to review their counterparts for graded
rings.

For a graded ring $R$, write $R_+ = R_1 \oplus R_2 \oplus \dots$. Clearly $R_+
\subset R$ is a homogeneous ideal.

\begin{proposition} 
Suppose $R = R_0 \oplus R_1 \oplus \dots$ is  a graded ring. Then if a subset
of $R_+$ generates $R_+$ as $R$-ideal, it generates $R$ as $R_0$-algebra.
\end{proposition} 
The converse is clear. 
Indeed, if $S \subset R_+$ generates $R$ as an $R_0$-algebra, clearly it
generates $R_+$ as an $R$-ideal. 
\begin{proof} 
Let $T \subset R$ be the $R_0$-algebra generated by $S$. We shall show
inductively that $R_n \subset T$. This is true for $n=0$. Suppose $n>0$ and the
assertion true for smaller $n$. Then, we have
\begin{align*}
R_n  & = RS \cap R_n   \ \text{by assumption} \\
& = (R_0 \oplus R_1 \oplus \dots R_{n-1})(S) \cap R_n \ \text{because $S$ bumps
the deg} \\
& \subset (R_0[S]) (S) \cap R_n \ \text{by inductive hypothesis} \\
& \subset R_0(S). \end{align*}
\end{proof} 
\begin{corollary} 
$R$ is noetherian if and only if $R_0$ is noetherian and $R$ is finitely
generated as $R_0$-algebra.
\end{corollary} 
\begin{proof} 
One direction is clear by Hilbert's basis theorem. For the other, suppose $R$
noetherian. Then $R_0$ is noetherian because any sequence $I_1 \subset I_2
\subset \dots$ of ideals of $R_0$ leads to a sequence of ideals $I_1 R \subset
I_2 R \subset \dots$, and since these stabilize, the original $I_1 \subset I_2
\subset \dots$ must stabilize too.  Since $R_+$ is a finitely generated
$R$-ideal, it follows that $R$ is a finitely generated $R_0$-algebra too.
\end{proof} 

The basic condition we will often need is that $R$ is finitely generated as an
$R_0$-algebra. We may also want to have that $R$ is generated by $R_1$, quite
frequently---this will imply a bunch of useful things about certain sheaves
being invertible. 
However, sometimes we have the first condition and not the second. Then the
next idea comes in handy.

\begin{definition} 
Let $R$ be a graded ring and $d \in \mathbb{N}$. We set $R^{(d)} = \bigoplus_{k
\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}} R_{kd}$.  If $M$ is a graded $R$-module and $l \in
\left\{0, 1, \dots, d-1\right\}$, we write $M^{(d,l)} = \bigoplus_{k \equiv l
\mathrm{mod} d} M_k$. Then $M^{(d,l)}$ is an $R^{(d)}$-module. 
\end{definition} 

One of the implications of the next few results is that, by replacing $R$ with
$R^{(d)}$, we can make the condition ``generated by terms of degree 1'' happen.
But first, we show that basic finiteness is preserved if we filter out some of
the terms.

\begin{proposition} \label{duple preserves finiteness}
Let $R$ be a graded ring and a finitely generated $R_0$-algebra. Let $M$ be a
finitely generated $R$-module.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Each $M_i$ is finitely generated over $R_0$, and the $M_i$ become zero when $i \ll
0$.
\item  $M^{(d,l)}$ is a finitely generated $R^{(d)}$ module for each $d,l$. In
particular, $M$ itself is a finitely generated $R^{(d)}$-module.
\item $R^{(d)}$ is a finitely generated $R_0$-algebra.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition} 
\begin{proof} 
Choose homogeneous generators $m_1, \dots, m_k \in M$. Then every nonzero
element of $M$ has degree at least $\min(\deg m_i)$.  This proves the
last part of (1). Moreover, let $r_1, \dots, r_p$ be generators of $R$ over
$R_0$.
We can assume that these are homogeneous with positive degrees $d_1, \dots, d_p>0$.
Then the space $M_i$ is spanned as an $R_0$-module by the elements
\[  r_1^{a_1} \dots r_p^{a_p} m_s  \]
where $\sum a_j d_j + \deg m_s = i$.  Since the $d_j>0$ and there are only
finitely many $m_s$'s, there are only finitely many such elements. This proves
the rest of (1).

To prove (2), note first that it is sufficient to show that $M$ is finitely
generated over $R^{(d)}$, because the $M^{(d,l)}$ are $R^{(d)}$-homomorphic
images.
Now $M$ is generated as $R_0$-module by the $r_1^{a_1} \dots r_p^{a_p} m_s $
for $a_1, \dots, a_p \geq 0$ and $s = 1, \dots,  k$.
In particular, by the euclidean algorithm in elementary number theory, it
follows that the 
$r_1^{a_1} \dots r_p^{a_p} m_s $
for $a_1, \dots, a_p \in [0, d-1]$ and $s = 1, \dots,  k$ generate $M$ over
$R^{(d)}$, as each power $r_i^{d} \in R^{(d)}$.

When we apply (2) to the finitely generated $R$-module $R_+$, it follows that $R^{(d)}_+$ is a finitely generated
$R^{(d)}$-module. This implies that $R^{(d)}$ is a finitely generated
$R_0$-algebra by Proposition~\ref{}.
\end{proof}

In particular, $R$ is integral over $R^{(d)}$. This can easily be seen
directly. The $d$th power of a homogeneous element lies in $R^{(d)}$.  
\begin{remark} 
Part (3), the preservation of the basic finiteness condition, could also be
proved as follows, at least in the noetherian case (with $S = R^{(d)}$). 
\begin{lemma} 
Suppose $R_0 \subset S \subset R$ is an inclusion of rings with $S$ noetherian. Suppose $R$ is a
finitely generated $R_0$-algebra and $R/S$ is an integral extension. Then $S$
is a finitely generated $R_0$-algebra.
\end{lemma} 
\begin{proof} 
Indeed, let $r_1, \dots, r_m$ be generators of $R/S$. Each satisfies an
integral equation $r_k^{n_k} + P_k(r_k) = 0$, where $P_k \in S[X]$ has degree
less than $n_k$. Let $S' \subset S$ be the subring generated over $R_0$ by the
coefficients of all these polynomials $P_i$.  
Then $R$ is, by definition, integral over $S'$; so is $S$, as a result. But
$S'$ is a finitely generated $R_0$-algebra and $S$ is a finitely generated
$S'$-module (because $R$ is a finitely generated $S'$-module and $S'$ is
noetherian, while $S \subset R$). Therefore, $S$ is a finitely generated $R_0$-algebra.
\end{proof} 
This result implies, incidentally, that if a finite group acts on a polynomial
ring $R[X_1, \dots, X_n]$, the ring of invariants is finitely generated.
\end{remark} 

We next show that we can have $R^{(d)}$ generated by terms of degree $d$ (i.e.
``degree 1'' if we rescale) for $d$ chosen large.
\begin{lemma} 
Hypotheses as above, there is a pair $(d, n_0)$ such that
\[  R_d M_n = M_{n+d}  \]
for $n \geq n_0$.
\end{lemma} 
\begin{proof} 
Indeed, select generators $m_1, \dots, m_k \in M$ and $r_1, \dots, r_p \in R$
as in the above proof; use the same notation for their degrees.
Let $d $ be the least common multiple of the $d_j$.  Consider the family of
elements
\[  s_i = r_i^{d/d_i} \in R_d. \]
Then suppose $m \in M_n$ for $n>ld + \sup \deg m_i$.  We have that $m$ is a sum
of products of powers of $r_i$ and the $m_i$, each term of which we can assume is
of degree $n$.  In this case, since at least one
of the $r_i$ must occur to power $\geq \frac{d}{d_i}$, we can write each term
in the sum as $s_i$ times something in $M_{n-d}$. 

In particular,
\[ M_n  = S_d M_{n-d}.  \]
\end{proof} 

\begin{proposition} 
Suppose $R$ is a graded ring and finitely generated $R_0$-algebra. Then there
is $d \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $R^{(d)}$ is generated over $R_0$ by $R_d$.
\end{proposition} 
\begin{proof} 
Suppose $d'$ is as in the previous lemma (replacing $d$, which we reserve for
something else), and choose $n_0$ accordingly. Let $d$ be a multiple of $d'$
which is greater than $n_0$.

Then we have $R_d R_n = R_{d+n}$ if $n \geq d$ since $d$ is a multiple of $d'$.
In particular, it follows that $R_{nd} = (R_d)^n$ for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$,
which implies the statement of the proposition.
\end{proof} 

As we will see below, taking $R^{(d)}$ does not affect the $\proj$, so this is
useful.

We next show that taking the $R^{(d)}$ \emph{always} preserves noetherianness.

\begin{proposition} \label{filtnoetherian}
If $R$ is noetherian, then so is $R^{(d)}$ for any $d>0$.
\end{proposition} 
\begin{proof} 
If $R$ is noetherian, then $R_0$ is noetherian and $R$ a finitely generated
$R_0$-algebra. The previous result, Proposition~\ref{duple preserves
finiteness},  now implies that $R^{(d)} $ is also a
finitely generated $R_0$-algebra, so it is noetherian.
\end{proof} 

The converse is also true, since $R$ is a finitely generated $R^{(d)}$-module.

\subsection{Localization of graded rings}
Next, we include a few topics that we shall invoke later on. 
First, we discuss the interaction of homogeneity and localization.

If $S \subset R$ is a multiplicative subset of a graded (or
$\mathbb{Z}$-graded) ring $R$ consisting of homogeneous elements, then $S^{-1}
R$ is a $\mathbb{Z}$-graded ring.  We write $R_{(S)}$ for the subring of
elements of degree zero; there is thus a map $R_0 \to R_{(S)}$.
If $S$ consists of the powers of a homogeneous element $f$, we write $R_{(f)}$
for $R_S$. If $\mathfrak{p}$ is a homogeneous ideal and $S$ the set of
homogeneous elements of $R$ not in $\mathfrak{p}$, we write
$R_{(\mathfrak{p})}$ for $R_{(S)}$.

We shall show that $R_{(f)}$ is a special case of something familiar.

\begin{proposition} \label{loc interpret as quotient ring}
Suppose $f$ is of degree $d$. Then $R_{(f)} \simeq R^{(d)}/(f-1)$.
\end{proposition} 
\begin{proof} 
The homomorphism $R^{(d)} \to R_{(f)}$ is defined to map $g \in R_{kd}$ to $g/f^d \in
R_{(f)}$.  This is then extended by additivity to non-homogeneous elements. It
is clear that this is multiplicative, and that the ideal $(f-1)$ is annihilated
by the homomorphism.
Moreover, this is surjective.

We shall now define an inverse map. Let $x/f^n \in R_{(f)}$; then $x$ must be
a homogeneous element of degree divisible by $d$. We map this to
the residue class of $x$ in $R^{(d)}/(f-1)$.  This is well-defined; if $x/f^n =
y/f^m$, then there is $N$ with
\[ f^N( xf^m - yf^n) = 0,  \]
so upon reduction (note that $f$ gets reduced to $1$!), we find that the
residue classes of $x,y$ are the same, so the images are the same.

Clearly this defines an inverse to our map.
\end{proof} 

\begin{corollary} 
Suppose $R$ is a graded noetherian ring. Then each of the $R_{(f)}$ is
noetherian.
\end{corollary} 
\begin{proof} 
This follows from the previous result and the fact that $R^{(d)}$ is noetherian
(Proposition~\ref{filtnoetherian}).\end{proof} 

More generally, we can define the localization procedure for graded modules.
\begin{definition} 
Let $M$ be a graded $R$-module and $S \subset R$ a multiplicative subset
consisting of homogeneous elements. Then we define $M_{(S)}$ as the submodule
of the graded module $S^{-1}M$ consisting of elements of degree zero. When $S$
consists of the powers of a homogeneous element $f \in R$, we write $M_{(f)}$
instead of $M_{(S)}$. We similarly define $M_{(\mathfrak{p})}$ for a
homogeneous prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$.
\end{definition} 

Then clearly $M_{(S)}$ is a $R_{(S)}$-module. This is evidently a functor from
graded $R$-modules to $R_{(S)}$-modules.

We next observe that there is a generalization of Proposition~\ref{loc interpret as quotient ring}.
\begin{proposition} \label{loc
module as quotient}
Suppose $M$ is a graded $R$-module, $f \in R$ homogeneous of degree $d$. Then
we have an isomorphism
\[ M_{(f)} \simeq M^{(d)}/(f-1)M^{(d)}  \]
of $R^{(d)}$-modules.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof} 
This is proved in the same way as Proposition~\ref{loc interpret as quotient
ring}. Alternatively, both are right-exact functors that commute with
arbitrary direct sums and coincide on $R$, so must be naturally isomorphic by
a well-known bit of abstract nonsense.\footnote{Citation needed.} 
\end{proof} 

In particular:
\begin{corollary} 
Suppose $M$ is a graded $R$-module, $f \in R$ homogeneous of degree 1. Then we
have
\[  M_{(f)} \simeq M/(f-1)M \simeq M\otimes_R R/(f-1).  \]
\end{corollary} 
\subsection{Definition}
Let $R=R_0 \oplus R_1 \oplus \dots$ be a \textbf{graded ring}.

\begin{definition} 
Let $\proj R$ denote the set of \emph{homogeneous prime ideals} of
$R$ that do not contain the \textbf{irrelevant ideal} $R_+$.\footnote{Recall that an ideal $\mathfrak{a} \subset R$ for $R$ graded is
\emph{homogeneous} if the homogeneous components of $\mathfrak{a}$ belong to
$\mathfrak{a}$.}

\end{definition} 

We can put a topology on $\proj R$ by setting, for a homogeneous ideal
$\mathfrak{b}$, $$V(\mathfrak{b}) = \{ \mathfrak{p} \in \proj R:
\mathfrak{p} \supset \mathfrak{b}\}$$.  These sets satisfy
\begin{enumerate}
\item $V( \sum \mathfrak{b_i}) = \bigcap V(\mathfrak{b_i})$.
\item  $V( \mathfrak{a}\mathfrak{b}) = V(\mathfrak{a}) \cup V(\mathfrak{b})$.
\item  $V( \rad \mathfrak{a}) = V(\mathfrak{a})$.
\end{enumerate}
Note incidentally that we would not get any more closed sets if we allowed all
ideals $\mathfrak{b}$, since to any $\mathfrak{b}$ we can consider its ``homogenization.''
We could even allow all sets.

In particular,  the $V$'s do in fact yield a topology on $\proj R$ (setting
the open sets to be complements of the $V$'s).
As with the affine case, we can define basic open sets. For $f$
homogeneous of positive degree, define $D'(f)$ to be the
collection of homogeneous ideals (not containing $R_+$) that do not contain $f$; clearly these are
open sets.

Let $\mathfrak{a}$ be a homogeneous ideal. Then I claim that:
\begin{lemma} 
\[  V(\mathfrak{a}) = V(\mathfrak{a} \cap R_+).  \]
\end{lemma} 
\begin{proof} 
Indeed, suppose $\mathfrak{p}$ is a homogeneous prime not containing $S_+$ such that all homogeneous
elements of positive degree in $\mathfrak{a}$ (i.e., anything in $\mathfrak{a}
\cap R_+$) belongs to $\mathfrak{p}$. We will
show that $\mathfrak{a} \subset \mathfrak{p}$.

Choose $a \in \mathfrak{a} \cap R_0$. It is sufficient to show that any such
$a$ belongs to $\mathfrak{p}$ since we are working with homogeneous ideals.
Let $f$ be a homogeneous element of positive degree that is not in
$\mathfrak{p}$.  Then $af \in \mathfrak{a} \cap R_+$, so $af \in \mathfrak{p}$.
But $f \notin \mathfrak{p}$, so $a \in \mathfrak{p}$.
\end{proof} 

Thus, when constructing these closed sets $V(\mathfrak{a})$, it suffices to
work with ideals contained in the irrelevant ideal. In fact, we could take
$\mathfrak{a}$ in any prescribed power of the irrelevant ideal, since taking
radicals does not affect $V$.

\begin{proposition} 
We have $D'(f) \cap D'(g) = D'(fg)$. Also, the $D'(f)$ form a basis for the
topology on $\proj R$.
\end{proposition} 
\begin{proof} The first part is evident, by the definition of a prime ideal. We prove the second.
Note that $V(\mathfrak{a})$ is the intersection of the $V((f))$ for the
homogeneous $f \in
\mathfrak{a} \cap R_+$. Thus $\proj R - V(\mathfrak{a})$ is the union of these $D'(f)$. 
So every open set is a union of sets of the form $D'(f)$.
\end{proof} 

We shall now 
show that the topology is actually rather familiar from the affine case, which
is not surprising, since the definition is similar.

\begin{proposition} 
$D'(f)$ is homeomorphic to $\spec R_{(f)}$ under the map
\[  \mathfrak{p}  \to \mathfrak{p} R_f \cap R_{(f)}  \]
sending homogeneous prime ideals of $R$ not containing $f$ into primes of
$R_{(f)}$.
\end{proposition} 
\begin{proof} 
Indeed, let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a homogeneous prime ideal of $R$ not containing
$f$. Consider $\phi(\mathfrak{p}) = \mathfrak{p} R_f \cap R_{(f)} $ as above.
This is a prime ideal, since $\mathfrak{p}  R_f$ is a prime ideal in $R_f$ by
basic properties of localization, and $R_{(f)} \subset R_f$ is a subring. (It
cannot contain the identity, because that would imply that a power of $f$ lay
in $\mathfrak{p}$.)

So we have defined a map $\phi: D'(f) \to \spec R_{(f)}$.  We can define its
inverse $\psi$ as follows. Given $\mathfrak{q} \subset R_{(f)} $ prime, we define a
prime ideal $\mathfrak{p} = \psi(\mathfrak{q})$ of $R$ by saying that a \textit{homogeneous} element $x \in
R$ belongs to $\mathfrak{p}$ if and only if $x^{\deg f}/f^{\deg x} \in
\mathfrak{q}$. It is easy to see that this is indeed an ideal, and that it is
prime by Proposition~\ref{homogeneousprimeideal}.

Furthermore, it is clear that $\phi \circ \psi $ and $\psi \circ \phi$ are the identity.
This is because $x \in \mathfrak{p}$ for $\mathfrak{p} \in D'(f)$ if and only
if $f^n x \in \mathfrak{p}$ for some $n$.

We next need to check that these are continuous, hence homeomorphisms.  If
$\mathfrak{a} \subset R$ is a homogeneous ideal, then $V(\mathfrak{a}) \cap
D'(f)$ is
mapped to $V(\mathfrak{a}R_f \cap R_{(f)}) \subset \spec R_{(f)}$, and vice
versa.
\end{proof}
