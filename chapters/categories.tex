N.B. This is a very rough, preliminary chapter. Currently it consists of notes
taken in an algebraic topology class. Serious editing is still needed.

\section{Introduction}
\newcommand{\ob}{\mathrm{ob}}
Categories are supposed to be places where mathematical objects live. 

\begin{definition} 
A \textbf{category} $\mathcal{C}$ consists of a collection of \textbf{objects},
$\mathrm{ob}\mathcal{C}$, and for each pair of objects $X, Y \in
\mathrm{ob}\mathcal{C}$, a set
of \textbf{morphisms} $\mathcal{C}(X, Y)$. 

For each object $X \in \ob\mathcal{C}$, there is an \textbf{identity morphism}
$1 \in \mathcal{C}(X, X)$. Next, there is a \textbf{composition law}
$\mathcal{C}(X, Y) \times \mathcal{C}(Y, Z) \to \mathcal{C}(X, Z), (g, f) \to g
\circ f$ for every
triple $X, Y, Z$ of objects, which is unital and associative. 

We write $X \to Y$ to denote an element of $\mathcal{C}(X, Y)$.
\end{definition} 

$\mathcal{C}$ is the storehouse for mathematical objects: groups, Lie algebras,
rings, etc.

\begin{remark} 
Some people use $\hom(X, Y)$  to denote the set of morphisms between $X, Y$.
\end{remark} 

\begin{remark} 
When we write $X \in \mathcal{C}$, it means $X \in \ob \mathcal{C}$. This is a
convenient convention. 
\end{remark} 

\begin{remark} 
The objects don't have to form a set; they can be large. But the things
$\mathcal{C}(X, Y)$ are sets.
\end{remark} 

Now, we do a bunch of examples.

\begin{example} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mathcal{C}  = \mathbf{Sets}$; the objects are sets, and the morphisms
are maps of sets. 
\item $\mathcal{C} = \mathbf{Grps}$; the objects are groups, and the morphisms
are maps of groups (i.e. homomorphisms).
\item $\mathcal{C} = \mathbf{LieAlg}$; the objects are Lie algebras, and the
morphisms are maps of Lie algebras (i.e. homomorphisms). 
\end{enumerate}
\end{example} 

There is \textbf{nothing} in the language of categories that lets you look
\emph{inside} an object. We think of vector spaces having elements, spaces
having points, etc. Categories treat these kinds of things as invisible. There
is nothing ``inside'' of $X \in \mathcal{C}$. The only way to understand $X$ is
to understand the homs into and out of $X$. 

We will elaborate on this in the future.


\begin{example} 
Let $G$ be a finite group. Then we an make a category $B_G$ where the objects
just consist of one point $\ast$ and the maps $\ast \to \ast$ are the elements
of $G$. The identity is the identity of $G$ and composition is multiplication
in the group. 

In this case, the category doesn't represent so much of a class of objects, but
instead we think of the composition law as the key thing. So a group is a
special kind of category.
\end{example} 

\begin{example} 
A monoid is precisely a category with one object. Recall that a \textbf{monoid}
has an associative and unital multiplication (not necessarily inverses).
\end{example} 


Figures... ADD THEM

\begin{remark} 
A lot of people said that they've seen this before in commutative algebra, but not necessarily
thoroughly.  So we will keep talking about this.
\end{remark} 


\subsection{Functors}
Let $\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D}$ be categories.

\begin{definition} 
A \textbf{functor} $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ consists of a function $F:
\ob \mathcal{C} \to \ob \mathcal{D}$ and, for each pair $X, Y \in \mathcal{C}$,
a map
$F: \mathcal{C}(X, Y) \to \mathcal{D}(FX, FY)$, which preserves the identity
maps and composition. 
\end{definition} 

\begin{example} 
There is a functor from $\mathbf{Sets} \to \mathbf{AbelianGrp}$ sending a set
$S$ to a free abelian group on the set.
\end{example} 

\begin{example} 
There is a functor from $\mathbf{TopSpaces} \to \mathbf{GradedAbGrp}$
(categories of topological spaces and graded abelian groups) sending a
space $X$ to its homology groups $H_*(X)$. We know that given a map of spaces,
we get a map of graded abelian groups. 
\end{example} 


\begin{example} 
What is a functor $B_G \stackrel{}{\to} \mathbf{Sets}$? Here $B_G$ is the
category alluded to above. 

The unique object $\ast$ goes to some set $X$. For each element $g \in G$, we
get a map $g: \ast \to \ast$ and thus a map $X \to X$. This is supposed to
preserve the composition law (which in $G$ is just multiplication), as well as
identities. 

In particular, we get maps $i_G: X \to X$ corresponding to each $g \in G$, such
that the following diagram commutes:
\[ \xymatrix{
X \ar[r]^{i_{g_1}} \ar[rd]^{i_{g_1g_2}} & X \ar[d]^{i_{g_2}} \\ & X 
}\]
So a functor $B_G \to \mathbf{Sets}$ is just a left $G$-action on a set $X$.
\end{example} 

``I never liked the idea of left and right action.  What about aliens on
another planet that didn't have left and right hands?''

Sometimes these are called \textbf{covariant functors}. Indeed:

\begin{definition} 
A \textbf{contravariant functor} from $\mathcal{C} \stackrel{F}{\to}\mathcal{D}$ is similar
data except that now a map $X \to Y$ now goes to a map $FY \to FX$. Composites
are required to be preserved, albeit in the other direction. 
\end{definition} 

``The reason we have shiny objects in nature is so that we will think of
contravariant functors. If you look in a mirror, it's like applying a
contravariant functor to yourself. This is kind of a myopic view of mankind.''

As you might guess:

\begin{example} 
A \textbf{contravariant} functor from $B_G$ to $\mathbf{Sets}$ corresponds to a
set with a \emph{right} $G$-action. 
\end{example} 

We will, in a week or so, define a contravariant version of homology when we
start studying cohomology.

\begin{example} 
On the category $\mathbf{Vect}$ of vector spaces, we have the contravariant
functor
\[ V \to V^{\ast}.  \]
\end{example} 

\begin{example} 
If we map $B_G \to B_G$ sending $\ast \to \ast$ and $g \to g^{-1}$, we get a
contravariant functor. 
\end{example} 

There is room, nevertheless, for something else. You could have something that
sent an object to a map. 
This is, I think, the reason for Maclane and Eilenberg to describe the next
property.

\subsection{Natural transformations}

The original paper of Eilenberg and Maclane was called ``On a general theory of
natural transformations.'' Maclane was a great guy, incidentally, besides
inventing homological algebra; there was a
picture in his office of someone holding a ray gun like a sci-fi movie yelling Tor, Tor, Tor. 


Suppose $F, G: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ are functors.

\begin{definition} 
A \textbf{natural transformation} $T: F \to G$ consists of the following data.
For each $X \in C$, there is a morphism $TX: FX \to GX$ satisfying the following
condition. Whenever $f: X \to Y$ is a morphism, the following diagram must
commute:
\[ \xymatrix{
FX \ar[d]^{TX }\ar[r] &  FY \ar[d]^{TY}  \\
GX \ar[r] &  GY
}.\]
\end{definition} 

When we say that things are ``natural'' in the future, we will mean that the
transformation between functors is natural in this sense. 

\begin{example} 
The \textbf{connecting homomorphism} $H_n(X, A) \to H_{n-1}(A)$ is  natural. This is going to be a little rocky, but let's say what this
means.

If we have pairs $(X, A) \to (Y, B)$, then the following diagram commutes
\[ \xymatrix{
H_n(X, A) \ar[d]  \ar[r] &  H_{n-1}(A) \ar[d] \\
H_n(Y, B) \ar[r] &  H_{n-1}(B)
}.\]
This identity is very important in the axiomatic characterization of homology,
due to Eilenberg-Steenrod. 

This is a little funny, and one has to think about which category we're talking
about. We can use the category of \textbf{pairs of topological spaces}. So the
objects here are pairs $(X, A)$ and morphisms are morphisms of pairs. 
\end{example} 

\begin{remark} 
``I'm here to put the 'funk' in functor.'' (Dick Gross came in to say hello.)
\end{remark} 

Some people don't like this. They don't like to use the language of categories.
If you really try to go in and examine things, it can be hard to figure out
what things really mean.
However, we will use it to state theorems conveniently. 


\begin{exercise} 
Work this out for yourselves. Suppose you have two functors $B_G \to
\mathbf{Sets}$, i.e. $G$-sets. What's a natural transformation between them?
\end{exercise} 

Now I want to prove a theorem.
\begin{theorem} 
If $f: X \to Y$ is a map in $\mathcal{C}$, and $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$
is a functor, then $F(f): FX \to FY$ is an isomorphism. 
\end{theorem} 
This is going to have a really stupid proof, but there is an important point
lurking here.
\begin{example} 
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the homotopy category of topological spaces
$\mathbf{hoT}$. The objects are topological spaces and the morphisms between
$X, Y$ are the continuous maps $X \to Y$ modulo the relation of being
homotopic. Homology is actually a functor from $\mathbf{hoT}$ to the category
of graded abelian groups.
\end{example} 


Hold on. Wait a second. Do we even know what an isomorphism in a category even
is? No, we don't.

\begin{definition} 
An \textbf{isomorphism} between objects $X, Y$ in a category $\mathcal{C}$ is a
map $f: X \to Y$ such that there exists $g: Y \to X$ with 
\[ g \circ f = 1_X, \quad f \circ g = 1_Y.  \]
\end{definition} 

This is more correct than the idea of being one-to-one and onto. A bijection of
topological spaces is not necessarily a homeomorphism.


\begin{proof} 
If we have maps $f: X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to X$ such that the composites both
ways are identities, then we can apply the functor $F$ to the whole dog and
pony show, and we find that since
\[ f \circ g = 1_Y, \quad g \circ f = 1_X,   \]
that
\[ F(f) \circ F(g) = 1_{F(Y)}, \quad F(g) \circ F(f) = 1_{F(X)}.  \]
We have used the fact that functors preserve composition and identities. This
implies that $F(f)$ is an isomorphism. 
\end{proof} 

Categories have a way of making things so general that they're trivial. Hence,
it is called general abstract nonsense. The things that become meaningful in
category theory are \textbf{not} the proofs. They are the \textbf{definitions}.
What we just did is very much in the spirit I was describing of categories. The
notion of isomorphism was defined in terms of properties of maps, not in terms
of things intrinsic (like injections and surjections). 

What's important here is not the theorem, but the \emph{definition of an
isomorphism.}



A lot of it for this course, though, is just getting used to the language and
the definitions.  

\section{Various universal constructions}

Last time, we introduced the idea of a category, and showed that a functor
takes isomorphisms to isomorphisms.  This was an amazing result with a trivial
proof.  Today, we will characterize objects in terms of maps.
\subsection{Initial and terminal objects}


\begin{definition} 
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. An \textbf{initial object} in a category is an
object $X \in \mathcal{C}$ with the property that $\mathcal{C}(X, Y)$ has one
element for all $Y \in \mathcal{C}$. 

So there is a unique map out of $X$ into each $Y \in \mathcal{C}$. 
\end{definition} 


\begin{example} 
If $\mathcal{C}$ is $\mathbf{Sets}$, then the empty set $\emptyset$ is an
initial object. The empty set is the set for indecisive people. To map out of
the indecisive set, you never have to decide where anything goes---it just
goes. There is a unique map from the empty set into any other set. 
\end{example} 

It seems too abstract to be useful. But it is. 

There is a dual notion, called a \textbf{terminal object}, where every object
can map into it in precisely one way. 
\begin{definition} 
A \textbf{terminal object} in a category $\mathcal{C}$ is an object $Y \in
\mathcal{C}$ such that $\mathcal{C}(X, Y) = \ast$ for each $X \in \mathcal{C}$.
\end{definition} 

\begin{example} 
The one point set is a terminal object in $\mathbf{Sets}$. 
\end{example} 

The important thing about the next ``theorems'' is the conceptual framework.
\begin{theorem} 
Any two initial (resp. terminal) objects in $\mathcal{C}$ are isomorphic by a
unique isomorphism.
\end{theorem} 
\begin{proof} 
The proof is really easy. We do it for terminal objects. Say $Y, Y'$ are
terminal objects. Then $\mathcal{C}(Y, Y')$ and $\mathcal{C}(Y', Y)$ are one
point sets. So there are unique maps $Y \to Y', Y' \to Y$, whose composites
must be the identities: we know that $\mathcal{C}(Y, Y) , \mathcal{C}(Y', Y')$
are one-point sets. This means that the maps $Y \to Y', Y' \to Y$ are
isomorphisms. 
\end{proof} 

There is a philosophical point to be made here. We have characterized an object
uniquely in terms of mapping properties. We have characterized it
\emph{uniquely up to unique isomorphism,} which is really the best you can do
in mathematics. Two sets aren't generally the ``same,'' but they may be
isomorphism up to unique isomorphism. Like the sets of your father and Darth
Vader: they're different (unless you're Luke), but the sets are isomorphic up
to unique isomorphism. 

Now we're going to talk about a bunch of other examples, which can all be
phrased via initial or terminal objects in some weird category. This,
therefore, is the proof for \emph{everything} we will do today.

Say we have a diagram
\[ 
\xymatrix{
A \ar[d] \ar[r] &  B \ar[d] \\
C \ar[r] &  X}.
\]
We can say what it means for this to be a \textbf{push-out}.

\begin{definition} 
A square like this,
\[ 
\xymatrix{
A \ar[d] \ar[r] &  B \ar[d] \\
C \ar[r] &  X}.
\]
is a \textbf{pushout square} (and $X$ is called the \textbf{push-out}) if, given a diagram
\[ \xymatrix{
A \ar[r] \ar[d]  &  B \ar[dd] \\ 
C \ar[rd] & \\
& Y
}\]
there is a unique map $X \to Y$ making the diagram
\[ \xymatrix{
A \ar[r] \ar[d]  &  B \ar[d] \\ 
C \ar[rd] \ar[r] & X  \ar[d]  \\
& Y
}.\]
\end{definition} 

\begin{example} 
The following is a pushout square in the category of abelian groups:
\[ \xymatrix{
\mathbb{Z}/2 \ar[r] \ar[d]  &  \mathbb{Z}/4 \ar[d]  \\ 
\mathbb{Z}/6 \ar[r] &  \mathbb{Z}/12
}.\]
In the category of groups, the push-out is actually
$\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$---this is a cool theorem. The point is that being a
push-out is actually dependent on the category.
\end{example} 

\begin{proposition} 
If the push-out of 
\[ \xymatrix{
A \ar[d] \ar[r] & B \\
C
}\]
exists, it is unique up to unique isomorphism. 
\end{proposition} 
\begin{proof} 
We can prove this in two ways. One is that suppose I had two pushout squares
\[ 
\xymatrix{
A \ar[d] \ar[r] &  B \ar[d] \ar[rdd] \\
C \ar[r] \ar[rrd] &  X \\
& & X'}.
\]
Then there are unique maps $X \to X', X' \to X$ from the universal property,
which have to be isomorphisms. 

Alternatively, we can phrase push-outs in terms of initial objects. We could
consider the category of all cartesian diagrams as above with $A,B,C$ and
mapping into something else; then the initial
object in this category is the push-out.
\end{proof} 

Now we abstract on this idea further.

\subsection{Colimits}


We now want to generalize the push-out. 
Instead of a shape with $A,B,C$, we do something more general.

Start with a \textbf{small} category $I$: this is not meant in a pejorative
sense, but that the objects of $I$ form a set. What you're supposed to picture
is that $I$ is something like the category
\[ 
\xymatrix{
\ast \ar[d] \ar[r] &  \ast \\
\ast
}
\]
or the category
\[ \ast \rightrightarrows \ast.  \]
We will formulate the notion of a \textbf{colimit} which will specialize to the
push-out when $I$ is the first case. $I$ is to be called the \textbf{indexing
category}. 

So we will look at functors 
\[ F: I \to \mathcal{C},  \]
which in the case of the three-element category, will just correspond to
diagrams
\[ \xymatrix{A \ar[d]  \ar[r] &  B \\ C}.  \]

We will call a \textbf{cone} on $F$ (this is an ambiguous term) an object $X
\in \mathcal{C}$ equip'd\footnote{Imagine I wrote that with an English accent.}
with maps $F_i \to X, \forall i \in I$ such that for all maps $i \to i' \in I$,
the diagram below commutes:
\[ \xymatrix{
F_i \ar[d] \ar[r] &  X \\
F_{i'} \ar[ru]
}.\]

An example would be a cone on the three-element category above: then this is
just a commutative diagram
\[ \xymatrix{
A \ar[r]\ar[d]  &  B \ar[d]  \\
C \ar[r] &  D
}.\]

\newcommand{\colim}{\mathrm{colim}}

\begin{definition} 
The \textbf{colimit} of the diagram $F: I \to \mathcal{C}$, written as $\colim
F$ or $\colim_I F $ or $\varinjlim_I F$, if it exists, is a cone $F \to X$ with
the property that if $F \to Y$ is any other cone, then there is a unique map $X
\to Y$ making the diagram
\[ \xymatrix{
F  \ar[rd] \ar[r] &  X \ar[d]  \\
& Y
}\]
commute. (This means that the corresponding diagram with $F_i$ replacing $F$
commutes for each $i \in I$.)
\end{definition} 

We could think of some weird category where cones are objects and the colimit
is initial. In any case, we see:

\begin{proposition} 
$\colim F$, if it exists, is unique up to unique isomorphism. 
\end{proposition} 

Let us go through some examples. We already looked at push-outs. 

\begin{example} 
Consider the category $I$ described by
\[ \ast, \ast, \ast, \ast.  \]
A functor $F: I \to \mathbf{Sets}$ is just a list of four sets $A, B, C, D$. 
The colimit is just the disjoint union $A \sqcup B \sqcup C \sqcup D$. This is
the universal property of the disjoint union. To hom out of the disjoint union
is the same thing as homming out of each piece.
\end{example} 


\begin{example} 
Suppose we had the same category $I$ but we went into abelian groups. Then $F$
corresponds, again, to a list of four abelian groups. The colimit is the direct
sum. Again, the direct sum is characterized by the same universal property. 
\end{example} 

\begin{example} 
Suppose we had the same $I$ ($\ast, \ast, \ast, \ast$) but the category of
groups was $\mathcal{C}$. Then the colimit is the
free product of the four groups. 
\end{example} 

\begin{example} 
Suppose we had the same $I$ and the category $\mathcal{C}$ was of commutative
rings with unit. Then the colimit is the tensor product. 
\end{example} 

So the idea unifies a whole bunch of constructions. 

Now let us take a different example.

\begin{example} 
Take 
\[ I = \ast \rightrightarrows \ast.  \]
So a functor $I \to \mathbf{Sets}$ is a diagram
\[ A \rightrightarrows B.  \]
Call the two maps $f,g: A \to B$. To get the colimit, we take $B$ and mod out
by the equivalence relation generated by $f(a) \sim g(a)$. 
To hom out of this is the same thing as homming  out of $B$ such that the
pullbacks to $A$ are the same. 

This is the relation \textbf{generated} as above, not just as above. It can get
tricky.
\end{example} 

\begin{definition} 
When $I$ is just a bunch of points  $\ast, \ast, \ast, \dots$ with no nonidentity morphisms, then the
colimit over $I$ is called the \textbf{coproduct}.
\end{definition} 

We use the coproduct to mean things like direct sums, disjoint unions, and
tensor products. 

\begin{definition} 
When $I$ is $\ast \rightrightarrows \ast$, the colimit is called the
\textbf{coequalizer}.
\end{definition} 

\begin{theorem} 
If $\mathcal{C}$ has all coproducts and coequalizers, then it has all colimits. 
\end{theorem} 

\begin{proof} 
Exercise. It's not too hard, but it is---I don't know, I'll talk about it on
Monday. It's worth racking your brain over.
\end{proof} 

One of the reasons I talked about colimits is that we can talk about it in
class and use the language. Also, there are a lot of examples we haven't done
in class as we haven't studied filtered colimits.

\subsection{Filtered colimits}

These are really useful, especially in algebraic topology. These are colimits
over special $I$.

\begin{definition} 
An indexing category is \textbf{filtered} if the following hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given $i_0, i_1 \in I$, there is a third object $i \in I$ such that both
$i_0, i_1$ map into $i$. 
\item Given any two maps $i_0 \rightrightarrows i_1$, there exists $i$ and $i_1
\to i$ such that the two maps $i_0 \rightrightarrows i$ are equal. Any two ways
of pushing an object into another can be made into the same eventually. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition} 

\begin{example} 
If $I$ is the category
\[ \ast \to \ast \to \ast \to \dots,  \]
i.e. the category generated by the poset $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$, then that is
filtered.
\end{example} 

\begin{example} 
If $G$ is a torsion-free abelian group, the category $I$ of finitely generated
subgroups of $G$ and inclusion maps is filtered. We don't actually need the
lack of torsion. 
\end{example} 

\begin{definition} 
Colimts over a filtered category are called \textbf{filtered colimits}.
\end{definition} 

\begin{example} 
Any torsion-free abelian group is the filtered colimit of its finitely
generated subgroups, which are free abelian groups.  
\end{example} 
This gives a simple approach for showing that a torsion-free abelian group is
flat.

\begin{proposition} 
If $I$ is filtered\footnote{Some people say filtering.} and $\mathcal{C} =
\mathbf{Sets}, \mathbf{Abgrp}, \mathbf{Grps}$, etc., and $F: I \to \mathcal{C}$
is a functor, then $\colim_I F$ exists and is given by the disjoint union of
$F_i, i \in I$ modulo the relation $x \in F_i$ is equivalent to $x' \in F_{i'}$
if $x$ maps to $x'$ under $F_i \to F_{i'}$. This is already an equivalence
relation. 
\end{proposition} 

The fact that the relation given above is transitive uses the filtering of the
indexing set. Otherwise, we would need to use the relation generated by it. 

\begin{example} 
Take $\mathbb{Q}$. This is the filtered colimit of the free submodules
$\mathbb{Z}(1/n)$.

Alternatively, choose a sequence of numbers $m_1 , m_2, \dots, $ such that for
all $p, n$, we have $p^n \mid m_i$ for $i \gg 0$. Then we have a sequence of
maps
\[ \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{m_1}{\to} \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{m_2}{\to}\mathbb{Z}
\to \dots.   \]
The colimit of this is $\mathbb{Q}$. There is a quick way of seeing this, which
is left to the reader.
\end{example} 
\lecture{10/18}

\subsection{Filtered colimits}
Last time, we talked about something called \emph{filtered colimits}. In this,
we had a special property of the indexing category $I$. It had the property
that given any two $i_0, i_1 \in I$, there was a third one into which they
mapped; moreover, given any two maps $i_0 \rightrightarrows i_1$, there was a
third one which coequalized them. Filtered colimits were defined as colimits
over a filtered category. 

When we have a functor $F: I \to \mathbf{Sets}, \mathbf{Grps},
\mathbf{Modules}$ taking values in a ``nice'' category (e.g. the category of
sets, modules, etc.), you can construct the colimit by taking the union of the
$F_i, i \in I$ and quotienting by the equivalence relation $x \in F_i \sim x'
\in F_{i'}$ if $f: i \to i'$ sends $x$ into $x'$. This is already an
equivalence relation, as one can check. 

Another way of saying this is that we have the disjoint union of the $F_i$
modulo the relation that $a \in F_i$ and $b \in F_{i'}$ are equivalent if and
only if there is a later $i''$ with maps $i \to i'', i' \to i''$ such that
$a,b$ both map to the same thing in $F_{i''}$. 


Suppose $F: I \to \mathbf{Ch}$ is a functor from a filtered category $I$ to the
category of chain complexes. For instance, $I$ could be the category $\ast \to
\ast \to \ast \to \dots$, leading to  a sequence of chain complexes
$C_*^{(0)}\to C_{*}^{(1)} \to \dots$.  This is the standard example you're
supposed to keep in mind. 

Then:
\begin{proposition} 
The homology of the colimit $\varinjlim_I F$ is the colimit of the homologies
$H(F_i)_{i \in F}$.
\end{proposition} 

\begin{proof} 
This is easy to prove. The deep idea is the formulation, not the proof. 

We will first prove that the  natural map
\[ \colim_I (H_*F) \to H_* \colim_I F   \]
is onto. Suppose we have something in $H_*(\colim F)$. Then this element $x$ is
represented by a $n$-cycle $z$ in $(\colim_I F)_n$ for some $n$. The colimit
$(\colim_I F)_n$ is just $\sqcup (F_i)_n$ modulo the equivalence relation. 
So $z$ is represented by some $z' \in (F_i)_n$. We don't, a priori, know that
$z'$ is a cycle, i.e. that $dz' = 0$. If this were the case, then we would have
a class in $\colim_I (H_* F)$ mapping onto $x$.

However, $dz'$ does go to zero in the colimit $\colim_I F$ as $z'$ is a cycle
in this colimit. Because it is filtered, we know that there is a map $f:i \to
i'$ such that $dz'$ goes to zero in $i'$. 
In $F_{i'}$, $z'$ becomes a cycle.  So the homology class of $x$ is in the
image of $H_n(F_{i'})$, which maps into the colimit $\colim_I H_n(F_i)$, which
in turn maps into the homology of the colimit. We have thus seen that
\[ \colim_I H_n(F_i) \to H_n(\colim_I F_i)  \]
is surjective. 

Now let us prove that it is one-to-one. Suppose $x \in \colim_I H_n(F)$ 
goes to zero in the homology of the colimit $\colim_I F$. So $x$ is represented
by some cycle $z \in Z_n(F_i)$.  In the colimit $\colim_I F$, $x$ is a
boundary $x = dy$. There is thus $\overline{y} \in F_{i'}$ representing $y$. 
By pushing forward into some mutually larger $i''$, we might as well suppose that $x = d
\overline{y}$ in
$F_i$ itself. This means that $x$ was zero in $H_n(F_i)$ itself.
\end{proof} 

I hope that made sense. If it didn't, it's one of those things that's more
complicated when you say it out loud than when you think it through for
yourself. I can't remember whether this was in Hatcher or not.
But then you'll just get what I said here in a less entertaining way. I find
these kinds of things hard to digest when someone is standing there telling it
to me. 

But anyway, this is one of the main uses of filtered colimits---or directed
colimits, as some people say.

The key observation made in class is that any diagram of the form
\[ 
\xymatrix{
X \ar[r]\ar[rd] &  Y \ar[d]  \\ 
& Z
}
\]
can be interpreted as a \emph{functor} from a suitable \emph{diagram category}. 
A \emph{cone} on a functor $F: I \to \mathcal{C}$ can be defined as a
collection of maps $Fi \to Z$.  There is a category of cones one can define,
and in this category, the initial object is the \emph{colimit}.  

Colimits don't have to exist.  

\begin{remark} 
Given a functor $F: I \to \mathcal{C}$ where $\mathcal{C}$ has a terminal
object, you can always consider the trivial cone over the functor mapping each
object  $Fi, i \in I$ into the terminal object. 
\end{remark} 

For limits, one reverses the arrows and defines a \emph{co-cone} over a functor
and considers the terminal object in the category of co-cones.


As we saw in class, given a functor $G$, we can always define a natural map
\[ G(\colim_I F) \to \colim_I GF.  \]
Here is an example. Given the category $J: \ast \to \ast$, a functor $J \to
\mathbf{Top}$ is just a morphism $X \to Y$. A colimit of this $X \to Y$ is just
a space (the cone) $C_F$ with maps 
\[ X \to C_F, Y \to C_F.  \]
If $G$ is a functor from $\mathbf{Top}$ to some other category, we have a
commutative diagram
\[ \xymatrix{
G(X) \ar[rd] \ar[rr] &  &  G(Y) \ar[ld] \\
& G(C_F)  \ar[ru]
}\]
	
From this, we get a map from this cone into the universal cone $C_{GF}$ over
$CG(X) \to CG(Y)$. In particular, we get a map
\[ G(C_F) \to C_{GF}.  \]
