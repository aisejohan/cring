\chapter{Fields and Extensions}
Recall that a field is an integral domain for which all non-zero elements are
invertible. Equivalently, the only two ideals of a field are $(0)$ and $(1)$
since any nonzero element is a unit.

\section{General remarks}

\begin{example}
One of the most familiar examples of a field is $\mathbb{Q}$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Another common field class of fields is the class of finite fields, for example
$\mathbb{Z}/(2)$.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise} In fact, for any maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}\subseteq R$, the
quotient $R/\mathfrak{m}$ is a field. 
\end{exercise}

\begin{example} If $F$ is a field and $R$ is any ring, then any ring homomorphism $f:F\rightarrow
R$ is either injective or the zero map (in which case $R=0$); this is because $ker(f)$ is an ideal in
$F$ but there are only two ideals, $(0)$ and $(1)$. If $f$ is identically
zero, then $1=0$ in $R$ so $R=0$ too.
\end{example}

\begin{definition} If $F$ is a field contained in a field $G$, then $G$ is said
to be a field extension of $F$.
\end{definition}

There are plenty of field extensions coming from both number theory and
geometry.

\begin{example} For example let $X$ be a Riemann surface. Let $k(X)$ denote the
set of meromorphic functions on $X$; clearly $k(X)$ is a ring under
multiplication and addition of functions. It turns out that in fact $k(X)$ is a
field, this is because if $f(z)$ is meromorphic, so is $1/f(z)$. For example,
let $\mathbb{C}_{\infty}$ be the Riemann sphere; then we know from complex
analysis that the ring of meromorphic functions $k(\mathbb{C}_{\infty}$ is the
field of rational functions $\mathbb{C}(z)$. More is true. In fact, there is
always a holomorphic function $X\rightarrow \mathbb{C}_{\infty}$ obtained by
taking a meromorphic function $f\in k(X)$ and considering it as a holomorphic
function $f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{C}_{\infty}$. In this case, $f$ induces a map
$k(\mathbb{C}_{\infty})\rightarrow k(X)$ by composing with $f$. In particular,
this map is an injection meaning that $k(X)$ is a field extension of
$\mathbb{C}[z]$.
\end{example}

\begin{example} The previous example is a more specific case of a general
phenomenon in geometry; let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be smooth projective curves (over a
field $k$). Then a morphism $f:C_1\rightarrow C_2$ makes $k(C_1)$ into a field
extension $k(C_2)$ 
\end{example}

\begin{definition}An element $\alpha\in F$ is said to be algebraic over $E$ if
$\alpha$ is the root of some polynomial with coefficients in $E$. If all
elements of $F$ are algebraic then $F$ is said to be an algebraic extension. If
$E\subseteq F$ is a field extension then $F$ is also a vector space over $E$
(the scalar action is just multiplication in $F$). The dimension of $F$
considered as an $E$-vector space is called the degree of the extension and is
denoted $[F:E]$. If $[F:E]<\infty$ then $F$ is said to be a finite extension
(note that all finite extensions are algebraic). Field extensions are sometimes
denoted $F/E$ for $E\subseteq F$.
\end{definition}

Algebraic number theory is in fact the study of algebraic extensions, in
particular, a field extensions $K$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ is said to be a number field
if it is a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}$.

Since field extensions $F/E$ are always vector spaces, there is a basis $B$ for
$F$ such that any element of $F$ is the linear combination of elements of $B$
with coefficients in $E$. Returning to the previous example, if $K$ is the
smallest field that contains $\mathbb{Q}$ and an algebraic number $\alpha$,
then$[K:\mathbb{Q}]$ is the degree of the minimal polynomial $f(x)$ of $\alpha$.


\subsection{The characteristic of a field}
\label{more-fields}

\noindent
Let $F$ be a field. As $\mathbf{Z}$ is the intial object of the category of
rings, there is a ring map $f : \mathbf{Z} \to F$, see
Exercise~\ref{integersinitial}.
The image of this ring map is an integral domain (as a subring of a field)
hence the kernel of $f$ is a prime ideal in $\mathbf{Z}$, see
Proposition~\ref{primeifdomain}.
Hence the kernel of $f$ is either $(0)$ or $(p)$ for some prime number $p$, see
Example~\ref{integerprimes}.

In the first case we see that $f$ is injective, and in this case
we think of $\mathbf{Z}$ as a subring of $F$. Moreover, since every
nonzero element of $F$ is invertible we see that it makes sense to
talk about $p/q \in F$ for $p, q \in \mathbf{Z}$ with $q \not = 0$.
Hence in this case we may and we do think of $\mathbf{Q}$ as a subring of $F$.
You can easily see that this is the smallest subfield of $F$ in this case.

In the second case, i.e., when $\text{Ker}(f) = (p)$ we see that
$\mathbf{Z}/(p) = \mathbf{Z}/p\mathbf{Z}$ is a subring of $F$. Since
$\mathbf{Z}$ is a principal ideal domain the ideal $(p)$ is maximal
and $\mathbf{Z}/p\mathbf{Z}$ is a field too. This field is always denoted
$\mathbf{F}_p$ and as before we think of $\mathbf{F}_p \subset F$
as a subfield. Clearly it is the smallest subfield of $F$.

Arguing in this way we see that every field contains a smallest subfield
which is either $\mathbf{Q}$ or finite equal to $\mathbf{F}_p$ for some
prime number $p$.

\begin{definition}
The \textbf{characteristic} of a field $F$ is $0$ if
$\mathbf{Z} \subset F$, or is a prime $p$ if $p = 0$ in $F$.
The \textbf{prime subfield of $F$} is the smallest subfield of $F$
which is either $\mathbf{Q} \subset F$ if the characteristic is zero, or
$\mathbf{F}_p \subset F$ if the characteristic is $p > 0$.
\end{definition}

\section{Field extensions}



\subsection{Transcendental Extensions}
There is a distinguished type of transcendental extension: those that are
``purely transcendental.'' 
\begin{definition} A field extension $E'/E$ is purely transcendental if it is
obtained by adjoining a set $B$ of algebraically independent elements. A set of
elements is algebraically independent over $E$ if there is no nonzero polynomial$P$
with coefficients in $E$ such
that $P(b_1,b_2,\cdots b_n)=0$ for any finite subset of elements $b_1, \dots,
b_n \in B$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example} The field $\mathbb{Q}(\pi)$ is purely transcendental; in
particular, $\mathbb{Q}(\pi)\cong\mathbb{Q}(x)$ with the isomorphism fixing
$\mathbb{Q}$. \end{example}
Similar to the degree of an algebraic extension, there is a way of keeping
trackof the number of algebraically independent generators that are required to
generate a purely transcendental extension.
\begin{definition} Let $E'/E$ be a purely transcendental extension generated by
some set of algebraically independent elements $B$. Then the transcendence
degree $trdeg(E'/E)=\#(B)$ and $B$ is called a transcendence basis for $E'/E$
(we will see later that $trdeg(E'/E)$ is independent of choice of basis).
\end{definition}
In general, let $F/E$ be a field extension, we can always construct an
intermediate extension $F/E'/E$ such that $F/E'$ is algebraic and $E'/E$ is
purely transcendental. Then if $B$ is a transcendence basis for $E'$, it is
alsocalled a transcendence basis for $F$. Similarly, $trdeg(F/E)$ is defined to
be
$trdeg(E'/E)$.
\begin{theorem} Let $F/E$ be a field extension, a transcendence basis exists.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} Let $A$ be an algebraically independent subset of $F$. Now pick a
subset $G\subseteq F$ that generates $F/E$, we can find a transcendence basis
$B$ such that $A\subseteq B\subseteq G$. Define a collection of algebraically
independent sets $\mathcal{B}$ whose members are subsets of $G$ that contain
$A$. The set can be partially ordered inclusion and contains at least one
element, $A$. The union of elements of $\mathcal{B}$ is algebraically
independent since any algebraic dependence relation would have occured in one
ofthe elements of $\mathcal{B}$ since the polynomial is only allowed to be over
finitely many variables. The union also satisfies $A\subseteq
\bigcup\mathcal{B}\subseteq G$ so by Zorn's lemma, there is a maximal element
$B\in\mathcal{B}$. Now we claim $F$ is algebraic over $E(B)$. This is because
ifit wasn't then there would be a transcendental element $f\in G$ (since
$E(G)=F$)such that $B\cup\{f\}$ wold be algebraically independent contradicting
the
maximality of $B$. Thus $B$ is our transcendence basis. \end{proof}
Now we prove that the transcendence degree of a field extension is independent
of choice of basis.
\begin{theorem} Let $F/E$ be a field extension. Any two transcendence bases for
$F/E$ have the same cardinality. This shows that the $trdeg(E/F)$ is well
defined. \end{theorem}
\begin{proof} 
Let $B$ and $B'$ be two transcendence bases. Without loss of generality, we can
assume that $\#(B')\leq \#(B)$. Now we divide the proof into two cases: the
first case is that $B$ is an infinite set. Then for each $\alpha\in B'$, there
is a finite set $B_{\alpha}$ such that $\alpha$ is algebraic over
$E(B_{\alpha})$ since any algebraic dependence relation only uses finitely many
indeterminates. Then we define $B^*=\bigcup_{\alpha\in B'} B_{\alpha}$. By
construction, $B^*\subseteq B$, but we claim that in fact the two sets are
equal. To see this, suppose that they are not equal, say there is an element
$\beta\in B\setminus B^*$. We know $\beta$ is algebraic over $E(B')$ which is
algebraic over $E(B^*)$. Therefor $\beta$ is algebraic over $E(B^*)$, a
contradiction. So $\#(B)\leq \sum_{\alpha\in B'} \#(B_{\alpha})$. Now if $B'$ is
finite, then so is $B$ so we can assume $B'$ is infinite; this means
\begin{equation} \#(B)\leq \sum_{\alpha\in B'}\#(B_{\alpha})=\#(\coprod
B_{\alpha})\leq \#(B'\times\mathbb{Z})=\#(B')\end{equation} with the inequality $\#(\coprod
B_{\alpha}) \leq \#(B'\times \mathbb{Z})$ given by the correspondence
$b_{\alpha_i}\mapsto (\alpha,i)\in B'\times \mathbb{Z}$ with $B_\alpha =
\{b_{\alpha_1},b_{\alpha_2}\cdots b_{\alpha_{n_\alpha}}\}$ Therefore in the
infinite case, $\#(B)=\#(B')$.

Now we need to look at the case where $B$ is finite. In this case, $B'$ is also
finite, so suppose $B=\{\alpha_1,\cdots\alpha_n\}$ and
$B'=\{\beta_1,\cdots\beta_m\}$ with $m\leq n$. We perform induction on $m$: if
$m=0$ then $F/E$ is algebraic so $B=\null$ so $n=0$, otherwise there is an
irreducible polynomial $f\in E[x,y_1,\cdots y_n]$ such that
$f(\beta_1,\alpha_1,\cdots \alpha_n) = 0$. Since $\beta_1$ is not algebraic over
$E$, $f$ must involve some $y_i$ so without loss of generality, assume $f$ uses
$y_1$. Let $B^*=\{\beta_1,\alpha_2,\cdots\alpha_n\}$. We claim that $B^*$ is a
basis for $F/E$. To prove this claim, we see that we have a tower of algebraic
extensions $F/E(B^*,\alpha_1)/E(B^*)$ since $\alpha_1$ is algebraic over
$E(B^*)$. Now we claim that $B^*$ (counting multiplicity of elements) is
algebraically independent over $E$ because if it weren't, then there would be an
irreducible $g\in E[x,y_2,\cdots y_n]$ such that
$g(\beta_1,\alpha_2,\cdots\alpha_n)=0$ which must involve $x$ making $\beta_1$
algebraic over $E(\alpha_2,\cdots \alpha_n)$ which would make $\alpha_1$
algebraic over $E(\alpha_2,\cdots \alpha_n)$ which is impossible. So this means
that $\{\alpha_2,\cdots\alpha_n\}$ and $\{\beta_2,\cdots\beta_m\}$ are bases for
$F$ over $E(\beta_1)$ which means by induction, $m=n$. \end{proof}

\begin{example} Consider the field extension $\mathbb{Q}(e,\pi)$ formed by
adjoining the numbers $e$ and $\pi$. This field extension has transcendence
degree at least $1$ since both $e$ and $\pi$ are transcendental over the
rationals. However, this field extension might have transcendence degree $2$ if
$e$ and $\pi$ are algebraically independent. Whether or not this is true is
unknown and the problem of determining $trdeg(\mathbb{Q}(e,\pi))$ is an open
problem.\end{example}
\begin{example} let $E$ be a field and $F=E(t)/E$. Then $\{t\}$ is a
transcendence basis since $F=E(t)$. However, $\{t^2\}$ is also a transcendence
basis since $E(t)/E(t^2)$ is algebraic. This illustrates that while we can
always decompose an extension $F/E$ into an algebraic extension $F/E'$ and a
purely transcendental extension $E'/E$, this decomposition is not unique and
depends on choice of transcendence basis. \end{example}
\begin{exercise} If we have a tower of fields $G/F/E$, then $trdeg(G/E)=trdeg(F/E)+trdeg(G/F)$. \end{exercise}

\subsection{Linearly Disjoint Field Extensions}
Let $k$ be a field, $K$ and $L$ field extensions of $k$. Suppose also that $K$ and $L$ are embedded in some larger field $\Omega$. 

\begin{definition} The compositum of $K$ and $L$ written $KL$ is $k(K\cup L)=L(K)=K(L)$. 
\end{definition}



\begin{definition} $K$ and $L$ are said to be linearly disjoint over $k$ if the following map is injective:
\begin{equation} \theta: K\otimes_k L\rightarrow KL \end{equation} defined by $x\otimes y\mapsto xy$. 
\end{definition}


\section{Algebraic closure}

\begin{definition} 
Let $F$ be a field. An \textbf{algebraic closure} of $F$ is a field
$\overline{F}$ containing $F$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}[\textbf{AC} 1]
\item $\overline{F} $ is algebraic over $F$.
\item $\overline{F}$ is \textbf{algebraically closed} (that is, every
non-constant polynomial in $\overline{F}[X]$ has a root in $\overline{F}$).
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition} 

\begin{theorem}
Every field has an algebraic closure.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $ K$ be a field and $ \Sigma$ be the set of all monic irreducibles in $ K[x]$. Let $ A = K[\{x_f : f \in \Sigma\}]$ be the polynomial ring generated by indeterminates $ x_f$, one for each $ f \in \Sigma$. Then let $ \mathfrak{a}$ be the ideal of $ A$ generated by polynomials of the form $ f(x_f)$ for each $ f \in \Sigma$.

\emph{Claim 1}. $ \mathfrak{a}$ is a proper ideal.

\emph{Proof of claim 1}. Suppose $ \mathfrak{a} = (1)$, so there exist finitely many polynomials $ f_i \in \Sigma$ and $ g_i \in A$ such that $ 1 = f_1(x_{f_1}) g_1 + \dotsb + f_k(x_{f_k}) g_k$. Each $ g_i$ uses some finite collection of indeterminates $ V_i \{x_{f_{i_1}}, \dotsc, x_{f_{i_{k_i}}}\}$. This notation is ridiculous, so we simplify it.

We can take the union of all the $ V_i$, together with the indeterminates $ x_{f_1}, \dotsc, x_{f_k}$ to get a larger but still finite set of indeterminates $ V = \{x_{f_1}, \dotsc, x_{f_n}\}$ for some $ n \geq k$ (ordered so that the original $ x_{f_1}, \dotsc, x_{f_k}$ agree the first $ k$ elements of $ V$). Now we can regard each $ g_i$ as a polynomial in this new set of indeterminates $ V$.
Then, we can write $ 1 = f_1(x_{f_1}) g_1 + \dotsb + f_n(x_{f_n}) g_n$ where for each $ i > k$, we let $ g_i = 0$ (so that we've adjoined a few zeroes to the right hand side of the equality).
Finally, we define $ x_i = x_{f_i}$, so that we have
$ 1 = f_1(x_1)g_1(x_1, \dotsc, x_n) + \dotsb + f_n(x_n) g_n(x_1, \dotsc, x_n)$.

Suppose $ n$ is the minimal integer such that there exists an expression of this form, so that

\[ \mathfrak{b} = (f_1(x_1), \dotsc, f_{n-1}(x_{n-1})) \]

is a proper ideal of $ B = K[x_1, \dotsc, x_{n-1}]$, but

\[ (f_1(x_1), \dotsc, f_n(x_n)) \]

is the unit ideal in $ B[x_n]$. Let $ \hat{B} = B/\mathfrak{b}$ (observe that this ring is nonzero). We have a composition of maps

\[ B[x_n] \to \hat{B}[x_n] \to \hat{B}[x_n]/(\widehat{f_n(x_n)}) \]

where the first map is reduction of coefficients modulo $ \mathfrak{b}$, and the second map is the quotient by the principal ideal generated by the image $ \widehat{f_n(x_n)}$ of $ f_n(x_n)$ in $ \hat{B}[x_n]$. We know $ \hat{B}$ is a nonzero ring, so since $ f_n$ is monic, the top coefficient of $ \widehat{f_n(x_n)}$ is still $ 1 \in \hat{B}$. In particular, the top coefficient cannot be nilpotent. Furthermore, since $ f_n$ was irreducible, it is not a constant polynomial, so by the characterization of units in polynomial rings, $ \widehat{f_n(x_n)}$ is not a unit, so it does not generate the unit ideal. Thus the quotient $ \hat{B}[x_n]/(\widehat{f_n(x_n)})$ should not be the zero ring.

On the other hand, observe that each $ f_i(x_i)$ is in the kernel of this composition, so in fact the entire ideal $ (f_1(x_1), \dotsc, f_n(x_n))$ is contained in the kernel. But this ideal is the unit ideal, so all of $ B[x_n]$ is in the kernal of this composition. In particular, $ 1 \in B[x_n]$ is in the kernal, and since ring maps preserve identity, this forces $ 1 = 0$ in $ \hat{B}[x_n]/(\widehat{f_n(x_n)})$, which makes this the the zero ring. This contradicts our previous observation, and proves the claim that $ \mathfrak{a}$ is a proper ideal.

Now, given claim 1, there exists a maximal ideal $ \mathfrak{m}$ of $ A$ containing $ \mathfrak{a}$. Let $ K_1 = A/\mathfrak{m}$. This is an extension field of $ K$ via the inclusion given by

\[ K \to A \to A/\mathfrak{m} \]

(this map is automatically injective as it is a map between fields). Furthermore every $ f \in \Sigma$ has a root in $ K_1$. Specifically, the coset $ x_f + \mathfrak{m}$ in $ A/\mathfrak{m} = K_1$ is a root of $ f$ since

\[ f(x_f + \mathfrak{m}) = f(x_f) + \mathfrak{m} = 0. \]

Inductively, given $ K_n$ for some $ n \geq 1$, repeat the construction with $ K_n$ in place of $ K$ to get an extension field $ K_{n+1}$ of $ K_n$ in which every irreducible $ f \in K_n[x]$ has a root. Let $ L = \bigcup_{n = 1}^{\infty} K_n$.

\emph{Claim 2}. Every $ f \in L[x]$ splits completely into linear factors in $ L$.

\emph{Proof of claim 2}. We induct on the degree of $ f$. In the base case, when $ f$ itself is linear, there is nothing to prove. Inductively, suppose every polynomial in $ L[x]$ of degree less than $ n$ splits completely into linear factors, and suppose

\[ f = a_0 + a_1x + \dotsb + a_nx^n \in L[x] \]

has degree $ n$. Then each $ a_i \in K_{n_i}$ for some $ n_i$, so let $ n = \max n_i$ and regard $ f$ as a polynomial in $ K_n[x]$. If $ f$ is reducible in $ K_n[x]$, then we have a factorization $ f = gh$ with the degree of $ g, h$ strictly less than $ n$. Therefore, inductively, they both split into linear factors in $ L[x]$, so $ f$ must also. On the other hand, if $ f$ is irreducible, then by our construction, it has a root $ a\in K_{n+1}$, so we have $ f = (x - a) g$ for some $ g \in K_{n+1}[x]$ of degree $ n - 1$. Again inductively, we can split $ g$ into linear factors in $ L$, so clearly we can do the same with $ f$ also. This completes the proof of claim 2.

Let $ \bar{K}$ be the set of algebraic elements in $ L$. Clearly $ \bar{K}$ is an algebraic extension of $ K$. If $ f \in \bar{K}[x]$, then we have a factorization of $ f$ in $ L[x]$ into linear factors

\[ f = b(x - a_1)(x - a_2) \dotsb (x - a_n). \]

for $ b \in \bar{K}$ and, a priori, $ a_i \in L$. But each $ a_i$ is a root of $ f$, which means it is algebraic over $ \bar{K}$, which is an algebraic extension of $ K$; so by transitivity of "being algebraic," each $ a_i$ is algebraic over $ K$. So in fact we conclude that $ a_i \in \bar{K}$ already, since $ \bar{K}$ consisted of all elements algebraic over $ K$. Therefore, since $ \bar{K}$ is an algebraic extension of $ K$ such that every $ f \in \bar{K}[x]$ splits into linear factors in $ \bar{K}$, $ \bar{K}$ is the algebraic closure of $ K$.

\end{proof}
