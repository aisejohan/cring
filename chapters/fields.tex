\chapter{Fields and Extensions}
Recall that a field is an integral domain for which all non-zero elements are
invertible. Equivalently, the only two ideals of a field are $(0)$ and $(1)$
since any nonzero element is a unit.


\begin{example}
One of the most familiar examples of a field is $\mathbb{Q}$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Another common field class of fields is the class of finite fields, for example
$\mathbb{Z}/(2)$.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise} In fact, for any maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}\subseteq R$, the
quotient $R/\mathfrak{m}$ is a field. 
\end{exercise}

\begin{example} If $F$ is a field, then any ring homomorphism $f:F\rightarrow
R$is either injective or the zero map; this is because $ker(f)$ is an ideal in
$F$but there are only two ideals, $(0)$ and $(1)$.
\end{example}

\begin{definition} If $F$ is a field contained in a field $G$, then $G$ is said
to be a field extension of $F$.
\end{definition}

There are plenty of field extensions coming from both number theory and
geometry.

\begin{example} For example let $X$ be a Riemann surface. Let $k(X)$ denote the
set of meromorphic functions on $X$; clearly $k(X)$ is a ring under
multiplication and addition of functions. It turns out that in fact $k(X)$ is a
field, this is because if $f(z)$ is meromorphic, so is $1/f(z)$. For example,
let $\mathbb{C}_{\infty}$ be the Riemann sphere; then we know from complex
analysis that the ring of meromorphic functions $k(\mathbb{C}_{\infty}$ is the
field of rational functions $\mathbb{C}(z)$. More is true. In fact, there is
always a holomorphic function $X\rightarrow \mathbb{C}_{\infty}$ obtained by
taking a meromorphic function $f\in k(X)$ and considering it as a holomorphic
function $f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{C}_{\infty}$. In this case, $f$ induces a map
$k(\mathbb{C}_{\infty})\rightarrow k(X)$ by composing with $f$. In particular,
this map is an injection meaning that $k(X)$ is a field extension of
$\mathbb{C}[z]$.
\end{example}

\begin{example} The previous example is a more specific case of a general
phenomenon in geometry; let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be smooth projective curves (over a
field $k$). Then a morphism $f:C_1\rightarrow C_2$ makes $k(C_1)$ into a field
extension $k(C_2)$ 
\end{example}

\begin{definition}An element $\alpha\in F$ is said to be algebraic over $E$ if
$\alpha$ is the root of some polynomial with coefficients in $E$. If all
elements of $F$ are algebraic then $F$ is said to be an algebraic extension. If
$E\subseteq F$ is a field extension then $F$ is also a vector space over $E$
(the scalar action is just multiplication in $F$). The dimension of $F$
considered as an $E$-vector space is called the degree of the extension and is
denoted $[F:E]$. If $[F:E]<\infty$ then $F$ is said to be a finite extension
(note that all finite extensions are algebraic). Field extensions are sometimes
denoted $F/E$ for $E\subseteq F$.
\end{definition}

Algebraic number theory is in fact the study of algebraic extensions, in
particular, a field extensions $K$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ is said to be a number field
if it is a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}$.

Since field extensions $F/E$ are always vector spaces, there is a basis $B$ for
$F$ such that any element of $F$ is the linear combination of elements of $B$
with coefficients in $E$. Returning to the previous example, if $K$ is the
smallest field that contains $\mathbb{Q}$ and an algebraic number $\alpha$,
then$[K:\mathbb{Q}]$ is the degree of the minimal polynomial $f(x)$ of $\alpha$.
\subsection{Transcendental Extensions}
There is a distinguished type of transcendental extension: those that are
``purely transcendental.'' 
\begin{definition} A field extension $E'/E$ is purely transcendental if it is
obtained by adjoining a set $B$ of algebraically independent elements. A set of
elements is algebraically independent over $E$ if there is no nonzero polynomial$P$
with coefficients in $E$ such
that $P(b_1,b_2,\cdots b_n)=0$ for any finite subset of elements $b_1, \dots,
b_n \in B$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example} The field $\mathbb{Q}(\pi)$ is purely transcendental; in
particular, $\mathbb{Q}(\pi)\cong\mathbb{Q}(x)$ with the isomorphism fixing
$\mathbb{Q}$. \end{example}
Similar to the degree of an algebraic extension, there is a way of keeping
trackof the number of algebraically independent generators that are required to
generate a purely transcendental extension.
\begin{definition} Let $E'/E$ be a purely transcendental extension generated by
some set of algebraically independent elements $B$. Then the transcendence
degree $trdeg(E'/E)=\#(B)$ and $B$ is called a transcendence basis for $E'/E$
(we will see later that $trdeg(E'/E)$ is independent of choice of basis).
\end{definition}
In general, let $F/E$ be a field extension, we can always construct an
intermediate extension $F/E'/E$ such that $F/E'$ is algebraic and $E'/E$ is
purely transcendental. Then if $B$ is a transcendence basis for $E'$, it is
alsocalled a transcendence basis for $F$. Similarly, $trdeg(F/E)$ is defined to
be
$trdeg(E'/E)$.
\begin{theorem} Let $F/E$ be a field extension, a transcendence basis exists.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} Let $A$ be an algebraically independent subset of $F$. Now pick a
subset $G\subseteq F$ that generates $F/E$, we can find a transcendence basis
$B$ such that $A\subseteq B\subseteq G$. Define a collection of algebraically
independent sets $\mathcal{B}$ whose members are subsets of $G$ that contain
$A$. The set can be partially ordered inclusion and contains at least one
element, $A$. The union of elements of $\mathcal{B}$ is algebraically
independent since any algebraic dependence relation would have occured in one
ofthe elements of $\mathcal{B}$ since the polynomial is only allowed to be over
finitely many variables. The union also satisfies $A\subseteq
\bigcup\mathcal{B}\subseteq G$ so by Zorn's lemma, there is a maximal element
$B\in\mathcal{B}$. Now we claim $F$ is algebraic over $E(B)$. This is because
ifit wasn't then there would be a transcendental element $f\in G$ (since
$E(G)=F$)such that $B\cup\{f\}$ wold be algebraically independent contradicting
the
maximality of $B$. Thus $B$ is our transcendence basis. \end{proof}
Now we prove that the transcendence degree of a field extension is independent
of choice of basis.
\begin{theorem} Let $F/E$ be a field extension. Any two transcendence bases for
$F/E$ have the same cardinality. This shows that the $trdeg(E/F)$ is well
defined. \end{theorem}
\begin{proof} 
Let $B$ and $B'$ be two transcendence bases. Without loss of generality, we can
assume that $\#(B')\leq \#(B)$. Now we divide the proof into two cases: the
first case is that $B$ is an infinite set. Then for each $\alpha\in B'$, there
is a finite set $B_{\alpha}$ such that $\alpha$ is algebraic over
$E(B_{\alpha})$ since any algebraic dependence relation only uses finitely many
indeterminates. Then we define $B^*=\bigcup_{\alpha\in B'} B_{\alpha}$. By
construction, $B^*\subseteq B$, but we claim that in fact the two sets are
equal. To see this, suppose that they are not equal, say there is an element
$\beta\in B\setminus B^*$. We know $\beta$ is algebraic over $E(B')$ which is
algebraic over $E(B^*)$. Therefor $\beta$ is algebraic over $E(B^*)$, a
contradiction. So $\#(B)\leq \sum_{\alpha\in B'} \#(B_{\alpha})$. Now if $B'$ is
finite, then so is $B$ so we can assume $B'$ is infinite; this means
\begin{equation} \#(B)\leq \sum_{\alpha\in B'}\#(B_{\alpha})=\#(\coprod
B_{\alpha})\leq \#(B'\times\mathbb{Z})=\#(B')\end{equation} with the inequality $\#(\coprod
B_{\alpha}) \leq \#(B'\times \mathbb{Z})$ given by the correspondence
$b_{\alpha_i}\mapsto (\alpha,i)\in B'\times \mathbb{Z}$ with $B_\alpha =
\{b_{\alpha_1},b_{\alpha_2}\cdots b_{\alpha_{n_\alpha}}\}$ Therefore in the
infinite case, $\#(B)=\#(B')$.

Now we need to look at the case where $B$ is finite. In this case, $B'$ is also
finite, so suppose $B=\{\alpha_1,\cdots\alpha_n\}$ and
$B'=\{\beta_1,\cdots\beta_m\}$ with $m\leq n$. We perform induction on $m$: if
$m=0$ then $F/E$ is algebraic so $B=\null$ so $n=0$, otherwise there is an
irreducible polynomial $f\in E[x,y_1,\cdots y_n]$ such that
$f(\beta_1,\alpha_1,\cdots \alpha_n) = 0$. Since $\beta_1$ is not algebraic over
$E$, $f$ must involve some $y_i$ so without loss of generality, assume $f$ uses
$y_1$. Let $B^*=\{\beta_1,\alpha_2,\cdots\alpha_n\}$. We claim that $B^*$ is a
basis for $F/E$. To prove this claim, we see that we have a tower of algebraic
extensions $F/E(B^*,\alpha_1)/E(B^*)$ since $\alpha_1$ is algebraic over
$E(B^*)$. Now we claim that $B^*$ (counting multiplicity of elements) is
algebraically independent over $E$ because if it weren't, then there would be an
irreducible $g\in E[x,y_2,\cdots y_n]$ such that
$g(\beta_1,\alpha_2,\cdots\alpha_n)=0$ which must involve $x$ making $\beta_1$
algebraic over $E(\alpha_2,\cdots \alpha_n)$ which would make $\alpha_1$
algebraic over $E(\alpha_2,\cdots \alpha_n)$ which is impossible. So this means
that $\{\alpha_2,\cdots\alpha_n\}$ and $\{\beta_2,\cdots\beta_m\}$ are bases for
$F$ over $E(\beta_1)$ which means by induction, $m=n$. \end{proof}

\begin{example} Consider the field extension $\mathbb{Q}(e,\pi)$ formed by
adjoining the numbers $e$ and $\pi$. This field extension has transcendence
degree at least $1$ since both $e$ and $\pi$ are transcendental over the
rationals. However, this field extension might have transcendence degree $2$ if
$e$ and $\pi$ are algebraically independent. Whether or not this is true is
unknown and the problem of determining $trdeg(\mathbb{Q}(e,\pi))$ is an open
problem.\end{example}
\begin{example} let $E$ be a field and $F=E(t)/E$. Then $\{t\}$ is a
transcendence basis since $F=E(t)$. However, $\{t^2\}$ is also a transcendence
basis since $E(t)/E(t^2)$ is algebraic. This illustrates that while we can
always decompose an extension $F/E$ into an algebraic extension $F/E'$ and a
purely transcendental extension $E'/E$, this decomposition is not unique and
depends on choice of transcendence basis. \end{example}
\begin{exercise} If we have a tower of fields $G/F/E$, then $trdeg(G/E)=trdeg(F/E)+trdeg(G/F)$. \end{exercise}

\subsection{Linearly Disjoint Field Extensions}
Let $k$ be a field, $K$ and $L$ field extensions of $k$. Suppose also that $K$ and $L$ are embedded in some larger field $\Omega$. 

\begin{definition} The compositum of $K$ and $L$ written $KL$ is $k(K\cup L)=L(K)=K(L)$. 
\end{definition}



\begin{definition} $K$ and $L$ are said to be linearly disjoint over $k$ if the following map is injective:
\begin{equation} \theta: K\otimes_k L\rightarrow KL \end{equation} defined by $x\otimes y\mapsto xy$. 
\end{definition}
