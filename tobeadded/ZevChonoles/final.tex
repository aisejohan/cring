I've chosen Problem 7.\\

{\sf\textbf{1.}} We know that the prime ideals of $S=R_Q/P_Q$ are in order-preserving bijection with the prime ideals $T\subset R$ with $P\subseteq T\subseteq Q$, that $M=Q_Q/P_Q$ is the unique maximal ideal in $S$, and that $0=P_Q/P_Q$ is prime in $S$ (note: this implies $S$ has no zero-divisors other than 0). Thus, because there is at least one prime $T\subset R$ with $P\subset T\subset Q$, there is at least one prime $T_Q/P_Q\subset S$ with $0\subset T_Q/P_Q\subset M$. This shows that $\dim(S)=\codim(M)\geq 2$ (since 0 is prime in $S$). Take any $a_1\in M$, $a_1\neq 0$ (i.e., $a_1$ is not a zero-divisor or a unit), and consider any prime $U_1\subset S$ minimal over $(a_1)$. We cannot have $U_1=M$, because Krull's Principal Ideal theorem would imply that $\codim(M)\leq 1$, contradiction. We certainly cannot have $U_1=0$, since $a_1\neq 0$. Thus $0\subset U_1\subset M$. \\

Now suppose we have shown there are primes $U_1,\ldots,U_n\subset S$ with $0\subset U_i\subset M$ for all $i$. We cannot have $\bigcup_{i=1}^n U_i=M$, because by Proposition 1.11 in Atiyah-Macdonald, we would have $M\subseteq U_i$ and hence $M=U_i$ for some $i$ (by the maximality of $M$). Thus, there is some $a_{n+1}\in M$ with $a_{n+1}\notin U_i$ for all $1\leq i\leq n$ (so that $a_{n+1}\neq0$, and $a_{n+1}$ not a unit because $a_{n+1}\in M$). Let $U_{n+1}\subset S$ be any prime minimal over $(a_{n+1})$. We cannot have $U_{n+1}=M$, again because this would imply $\codim(M)\leq 1$, we cannot have $U_{n+1}=0$ because $a_{n+1}\neq0$, and obviously, $U_{n+1}\neq U_i$ for $1\leq i\leq n$, because $a_{n+1}\in U_{n+1}$ and $a_{n+1}\notin U_i$ for $1\leq i\leq n$. Thus, $U_{n+1}$ is a distinct prime ideal with $0\subset U_{n+1}\subset M$. By induction, we can continue this process, so that there must be infinitely many primes $U_i\subset S$ lying strictly between 0 and $M$, and hence there must be infinitely many primes $T\subset R$ lying strictly between $P$ and $Q$. \\

\num{2.} Suppose that every $a\in P_1$ had $a\in P_i$ for some $2\leq i\leq t$. Then $P_1\subseteq\bigcup_{i=2}^t P_i$, and by Proposition 1.11 in Atiyah-Macdonald, $P_1\subseteq P_i$ for some $2\leq i\leq t$. But all the $P_i$ are minimal over $I$, so that $P_1=P_i$, contradiction. Thus, there is some $a\in P_1$ for which $a\notin P_i$ for $2\leq i\leq t$, and clearly $a\notin I$ because $I\subseteq P_i$ for all $i$. By Proposition 3.11 in Atiyah-Macdonald, we know that the prime ideals of $R[a^{-1}]$ are in order-preserving bijection with the prime ideals of $R$ disjoint from $\{1,a,a^2,\ldots\}$, that $I^e\neq R[a^{-1}]$ because $a\notin I$, and that $P_1^e= R[a^{-1}]$ because $a\in P_1$. Because $I\subseteq P_i$ for all $2\leq i\leq t$, we have $I^e\subseteq P_i^e$ for all $2\leq i\leq t$, so the $P_i^e$ are primes of $R[a^{-1}]$ containing $I^e$. If there were a prime $Q\subset R[a^{-1}]$ with $I^e\subseteq Q\subset P_i^e$, we would have that the prime ideal $Q^c\subset R$ satisfies $I\subseteq I^{ec}\subseteq Q^c\subset P_i^{ec}=P_i$, contradicting the minimality of $P_i$. Thus, the $P_i^e$ for $2\leq i\leq t$ are minimal over $I^e$, and $P_1^e=R[a^{-1}]$.  \\

\num{3.}     \\

\num{4.} Consider the case $t=2$, so that $M\simeq I_1\oplus I_2$. Becaus $I_1$ and $I_2$ are relatively prime, we have that $I_1+I_2=R$, so that the map $g:I_1\oplus I_2\rightarrow R$ defined by $g(a_1,a_2)=a_1+a_2$ is surjective. The kernel is the set of $(a,-a)$ where $a\in I_1\cap I_2$, which because $I_1$ and $I_2$ are relatively prime, is equal to $I_1I_2$ (see bottom p.6 of Atiyah-Macdonald). Thus we have an exact sequence
\[0\rightarrow I_1I_2\stackrel{f}{\rightarrow} I_1\oplus I_2\stackrel{g}{\rightarrow} R\rightarrow 0\]
where $f$ is the map $f(a)=(a,-a)$. The map $h$ from $I_1\oplus I_2$ to $I_1I_2$ defined by $h(a_1,a_2)=a_1x-a_2y$ where $x\in I_1$, $y\in I_2$ satisfy $x+y=1$ ($x$ and $y$ exist because $I_1+I_2=R$), is a retract of $f$ - that is, $f(h(a))=f(a,-a)=a(x+y)=a$ - and thus the sequence splits (see p.16 of Eisenbud, as well as top of p.17). Thus, $I_1\oplus I_2\simeq R\oplus I_1I_2$, and by induction (or repeated application, either will suffice), we are done.\\

%where the unique prime factorizations of $I_1$ and $I_2$ are $I_1=P_1^{a_1}\cdots P_n^{a_n}=P_1^{a_1}\cap\cdots\cap P_n^{a_n}$ and $I_2=Q_1^{b_1}\cdots Q_m^{b_m} = Q_1^{b_1}\cap\cdots\cap Q_m^{b_m}$, where the $P_i$ and $Q_j$ are prime ideals of $R$ (products and intersections of distinct prime ideals are the same, as all non-zero primes in a Dedekind domain are maximal and hence pairwise coprime). We know that $R$ is a Dedekind domain, and hence locally a DVR. At a prime ideal $T\subset R$, with $T\neq P_i, Q_j$ for all $i$ and $j$, we have $I_1,I_2\subset R-T$ and hence $M_T\simeq(I_1\oplus I_2)\otimes R_T\simeq (I_1)_T\oplus (I_2)_T\simeq($    \\

\num{5.} Let $R=k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ for any field $k$. We proved in class that $\dim(R)=n$. Let $A=R/(f)\simeq k[\bar{x}_1,\ldots,\bar{x}_n]$ for an irreducible $f\in R$ (throughout, bars will denote reduction mod $f$, although an element of a ring and its image in a localization will be identified without comment). By Corollary 11.18 in Atiyah-Macdonald, $\dim(A)=n-1$, because $f$ irreducible implies $f$ is not 0 or a unit, and there are no zero-divisors in $R$ other than 0. WLOG, let $P=(0,\ldots,0)$ be a point on the variety defined by $f=0$ (one can move an arbitrary point to the origin by a linear change of variables, which is an isomorphism). Let $M=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\subset R$, and let $M_M=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\subset R_M$ be the maximal ideal of the local ring $R_M$. Let $m=M/(f)=(\bar{x}_1,\ldots,\bar{x}_n)\subset A$ be the maximal ideal of $A$ associated to the point $P$. Finally, let $m_m=(\bar{x}_1,\ldots,\bar{x}_n)\subset A_m$ be the maximal ideal of the local ring $A_m$, and note that $m_m\simeq M_M/(f)$ by Corollary 3.4 in Atiyah-Macdonald. By Corollary 11.27 in Atiyah-Macdonald, we have that $\dim(A_m)=n-1$. By Theorem 11.22 in Atiyah-Macdonald, $A_m$ is a regular local ring iff $\dim_k(m_m/m_m^2)=n-1$. We have that $m_m/m_m^2\simeq M_M/(M_M^2+(f))$. Because $P=(0,\ldots,0)$ is a point on the variety $f=0$, we have that $f$ has no constant term, i.e. $f\in M$ (and also $f\in M_M$). \\

%(\bar{x}_1,\ldots,\bar{x}_n)/(\bar{x}_1,\ldots,\bar{x}_n)^2  (x_1,\ldots,x_n)/(((x_1,\ldots,x_n)^2+(f))=

If all partial derivatives of $f$ vanish at $P$, then all partial derivatives of $f$ have no constant term, so that $f$ has no terms of the form $ax_i$ for $a\in k$, which combined with the fact that $f$ has no constant term implies $f\in M^2$ (and also $f\in M_M^2$). The converse, that $f\in M^2$ (or equivalently $f\in M_M^2$) implies all partial derivatives of $f$ vanish at $P$, is obvious by the product rule. Thus, if all partial derivatives of $f$ vanish at $P$, we have that $f\in M_M^2$, and thus $m_m/m_m^2\simeq M_M/(M_M^2+(f))=M_M/M_M^2=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)/(x_1,\ldots,x_n)^2\simeq k^n$ is $n$-dimensional, so that $A_m$ is not regular.\\

Now suppose not all partial derviatives of $f$ vanish at $P$, i.e. some $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(P)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(0,\ldots,0)\neq0$. Because $f\in M=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$, we have that $f=\sum_{i=1}^n g_ix_i$ for some $g_i\in R$, so that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}=\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial g_i}{\partial x_i}x_i + g_i$, so that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(0,\ldots,0)=\sum_{i=1}^n g_i(0,\ldots,0)\neq0$, so at least one $g_j\notin M$, hence $g_j\notin M_M$, But $M_M$ is the maximal ideal of $R_M$, so that $g_j$ is a unit in $R_M$. We certainly have that $M_M=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\supseteq (x_1,\ldots,x_{j-1},f,x_{j+1},\ldots,x_n)$, but because $g_j$ is a unit in $R_M$, we also have $(x_1,\ldots,x_{j-1},f,x_{j+1},\ldots,x_n)=(x_1,\ldots,x_{j-1},\sum_{i=1}^n g_ix_i,x_{j+1},\ldots,x_n)=(x_1,\ldots,x_{j-1},g_ix_i,\ldots,x_n)=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$. Thus, if not all partial derivatives of $f$ vanish at $P$, we have $M_M=(x_1,\ldots,x_{j-1},f,x_{j+1},\ldots,x_n)$, and thus $m_m=M_M/(f)=(\bar{x}_1,\ldots,\bar{x}_{j-1},\bar{x}_{j+1},\ldots,\bar{x}_n)$ is generated by exactly $n-1$ elements. Thus $\dim_k(m_m/m_m^2)=n-1$, and $A_m$ is regular. \\

(I'm sure this all could have been done more easily, and with less notation... oh well)\\

\num{7.} We have that $R$ is a Noetherian ring, that $S\supseteq R$ is an $R$-algebra which is finitely generated as an $R$-module, and $M\subset R$ is a maximal ideal. In particular, we have that $S$ is integral over $R$ (by Proposition 5.1 in Atiyah-Macdonald, because obviously every $x\in S$ satisfies $R[x]\subseteq S$ and $S$ is already known to be finitely generated as an $R$-module), and $S$ is Noetherian (as a ring) by Proposition 7.2 of Atiyah-Macdonald. \\

Let $f:R\hookrightarrow S$ be the inclusion of $R$ into $S$, and let $\pi:\Spec(S)\rightarrow\Spec(R)$ be the induced map. Let $M^e=MS\subset S$ denote the extension of $M$ to an ideal of $S$, and note that any ideal $I\subset S$ has $I\supseteq M^e$ iff $I\supseteq M$. We proved in class that in a Noetherian ring, there are only finitely many prime ideals minimal over a given ideal, so that there are only finitely many prime ideals $N_1,\ldots,N_r\subset S$ minimal over $M^e$. Note that $N_i\cap R=M$, because $N_i\cap R\supseteq M$ and $M$ is maximal in $R$, so either $N_i\cap R=M$ or $N_i\cap R=R$, but $N_i\cap R=R$ iff $1\in N_i$, which is not the case. By Corollary 5.8 in Atiyah-Macdonald, each $N_i$ must be maximal as well. Any prime $P\subset S$ with $P\cap R=M$ must have $P\supseteq M$, hence $P\supseteq M^e$, and thus $P\supseteq N_i$ for some $i$ because the $N_i$ are minimal over $M^e$, but the $N_i$ are maximal ideals of $S$, so that  $P=N_i$. Thus, the only prime ideals of $S$ containing $M$ are the $N_1,\ldots,N_r$, which we have shown to be maximal.\\

I can't seem to prove that the size of the fiber is $\leq t$, though. However, once this was accomplished, I'm sure the proof that all fibers $\pi^{-1}(P)$ have size bounded by $t$ would proceed by localizing at any $P\in\Spec(R)$, which is equivalent to restricting $\pi$ to a map on an open subset of $\Spec(S)$ which would still contain all the primes in the fiber $\pi^{-1}(P)$, only now $P$ is maximal (the number of generators of $S$ as an $R$-module cannot increase upon localizing $S$ and $R$, so we don't have to worry about ending up with a bigger $t$).

%I'm sorry I didn't get more done, but I've been busy preparing for another final coming up. Thanks again for an excellent semester, and see you in 253 this fall! I'm sure the SMALL program will be great preparation.
