\chapter*{Introduction}

This  is a massively collaborative, open source textbook on
commutative algebra. The project is currently in its infancy, and needs
contributions! (See the next chapter for how to contribute.)

This document, and
its \LaTeX\ source code, may be downloaded from
\url{http://people.fas.harvard.edu/~amathew/cr.html}.

\section*{Prerequisites}
This book is intended to be accessible to undergraduates. The prerequisite  is a basic acquaintance with modern
algebra. While even the notion of a ring is introduced from scratch, it is
done so rather rapidly, and the reader is advised to consult another source.
In addition, we do not hesitate to use the language of categories,
which is developed in Chapter~\ref{categorychapter}. The book is intended to
provide preparation to study textbooks on algebraic geometry such as
\cite{Ha77}.

\section*{The CRing project}

The CRing project is an attempt started by several undergraduates to create
a collaborative, open-source textbook on commutative algebra. 
It started with a collection of class notes ``live-\TeX ed'' by Akhil Mathew
taken in a course (Math 221) taught by Jacob Lurie at Harvard.

The main website for this project is 
\url{http://people.fas.harvard.edu/~amathew/cr.html}.
In addition, there is a
git repository at \url{http://cring.adeel.ru}. The git repository provides 
slightly newer versions of the source code.

Discussion of the project can happen at the CRing project blog,
