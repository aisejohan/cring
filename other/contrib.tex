\section*{How to contribute}


To contribute, email submissions to \verb=cring.project@gmail.com=. 
Contributions do not have to be polished; they can be rough sketches written
for any purpose at all---half-finished homework writeups, term papers, blog
posts, and others are all welcome.

Contributions in editing the chapters are also welcome. To do this, simply
download the source, edit the files, and email the modifications to the same
address.
